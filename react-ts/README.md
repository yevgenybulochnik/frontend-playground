# React Typescript Setup

Boilerplate and testing repo for a react typescript setup. Ideally, I would like to create a development environment for building react apps with TDD. I would like to use mocha and chai for testing. Additionally, build a production app that is web-based and as an electron application.

### Testing Libs
- Mocha
- Chai
- Enzyme
- Jsdom

### Dev Libs
- Webpack
- Nodemon
